/**
 * Single entity that defines multiple types of user for our various implementations.
 *
 * We cannot use inheritance in this case because it would mean we would have to employ the
 * {@link org.hibernate.annotations.Any} annotation on the user entity of {@link SavedSearch}.
 *
 * This annotation requires you to define in place all the possible concrete types the field could
 * take at runtime.  This in turn would mean we have to define implementation-specific children of
 * {@link SavedSearch}, but then we would lose the centralisation of {@link SavedQuery} and other search types.
