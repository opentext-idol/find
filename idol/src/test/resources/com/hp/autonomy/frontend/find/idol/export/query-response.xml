            <autn:summary>Runaway Cats Won't Go Far but May Be Hard to Find. If the cat does get further, it's because a
                dog or another cat chased it. The station is run by Catalyst for Cats, Inc., a group of volunteers
                trying to control the feral cat population in Santa Barbara County by trapping, sterilizing and
                returning and then feeding wild cats in the area. Owned, lost cats show up at feeding stations more
                often than one would imagine," said Marci Kladnik, a Catalyst for Cats volunteer and columnist for the
                Cat Writers' Association. That is something all cat owners need to do for their cats," she said.

                        Runaway Cats Won't Go Far but May Be Hard to Find
                        LOS ANGELES February 19, 2014 (AP)
                        By SUE MANNING Associated Press
                        Associated Press
                        If a scared dog bolts from home, it's likely to run as fast and far as it can. But if a house
                        cat panics, it's more likely to slink away and stop at the first good hiding place it finds.
                        Because the getaway is so different, the search has to be, too, said Nancy Peterson, cat
                        programs manager for the Humane Society of the United States and a registered veterinarian
                        technician.
                        Don't run to a shelter or post signs right away, she said. Immediately after you notice your pet
                        is missing, search your yard, contact neighbors and show a photo to mail carriers, delivery
                        drivers and paperboys.
                        "Most cats that escape or leave home won't go more than five houses away, so you should go to
                        neighbor homes and ask if you can check their backyards," she said. "If the cat does get
                        further, it's because a dog or another cat chased it. Unfortunately, the farther away it gets,
                        the harder it is for it to get home."
                        The search for your feline friend tends to be tougher going than if you had lost a dog, experts
                        say. Good Samaritans often come to the rescue of dog owners, picking up pooches and making a
                        call to the owner or taking them to a shelter. But there is no cavalry for cats, and domestic
                        ones are not easily caught 窶?you can't just open a car door and coax it to hop in. But you can
                        protect against the loss of your cat by microchipping it and strapping on an ID collar.
                        Even long-lost cats can be found, a joy that Mickey and June Wilson experienced. When an
                        8,700-acre wildfire came close to their Santa Barbara, Calif., home in May 2009, the couple
                        grabbed their cat Morris and evacuated.
                        For one night, they stayed in a motel in Buellton, about 45 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.
                        When Mickey Wilson went to get luggage from the car, Morris, rambling freely in the second-story
                        room, escaped. Wilson searched everywhere, following several tips, but came up empty-handed.
                        Heartbroken, Wilson and his wife returned home the next day without Morris. Relatives went up a
                        few times after that to look but couldn't find the cat.
                        Four months later, Wilson got a call from a woman who found Morris behind a restaurant at a
                        feral cat feeding station. The station is run by Catalyst for Cats, Inc., a group of volunteers
                        trying to control the feral cat population in Santa Barbara County by trapping, sterilizing and
                        returning and then feeding wild cats in the area.
                        "Owned, lost cats show up at feeding stations more often than one would imagine," said Marci
                        Kladnik, a Catalyst for Cats volunteer and columnist for the Cat Writers' Association.
                        Morris was in good shape except for the tip of his tail, which was broken.
                        "If he hadn't had a name tag on his collar, we would never have seen him again," said Wilson, a
                        retired aircraft engineer.
                        Wilson had to put Morris down about six months ago because of bladder problems. "He was a
                        special cat," Wilson said. "And we enjoyed him up to the very end."
                        Morris' discovery shows even a long search isn't hopeless.
                        "Don't give up! Cats can return home months after being lost," Orange County Animal Control
                        spokesman Ryan Drabek said. But he says that most of the cats the facility takes in each year
                        are feral. Only a third of them are domesticated, he said.
                        But there's always hope if a cat has ID, said Dr. Karen "Doc" Halligan, author and chief
                        veterinary officer of the Lucy Pet Foundation.
                        "Both my cats have breakaway collars, tags and microchips. That is something all cat owners need
                        to do for their cats," she said.

                        What We Might Learn From Snoring Weather Cats

                        Sometimes it feels like all the fancy meteorological machinery and prognostication equipment is
                        actually working. And that the weatherfolks may finally be able to predict 窶?albeit with
                        constant updates and countless hedge words 窶?what the weather is going to be.
                        At least for the next day or so.
                        But is that good enough?
                        H.H.C. Dunwoody didn't think so. Dunwoody was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Signal Service,
                        predecessor to today's National Weather Service. In an 1883 book 窶?commissioned by the U.S. War
                        Department and approved by the Chief Signal Officer 窶?Dunwoody lamented that "the ablest
                        meteorologists of today, aided by the most perfect meteorological instruments and the results of
                        years of accurate instrumental observations, are still unable to give reliable forecasts of the
                        weather for a longer period than two or three days, and frequently not longer than twenty-four
                        hours."
                        It was Dunwoody's belief that the meteorologists should not only focus on advancing forecast
                        technology, but on studying the natural world as well. "It is possible that a more accurate
                        observation of the condition of plants or the condition or actions of animals," he wrote in the
                        introduction to Signal Service Notes, Issue 9, "might lead to some valuable suggestion in this
                        important field of investigation."
                        Scientific inquiry meets adages and old saws. Producing perhaps a sort of Old Scientist's
                        Almanac.
                        Double Rainbow

                        To further the pursuit, the Signal Service gathered folk wisdom from here and yond, proverbs
                        concerning the sun, the moon, the stars, winds, rainbows, mist and fog: The appearance of two or
                        three rainbows indicates fair weather for present, but settled and heavy rains in a few days.
                        And proverbs pertaining to plants, such as clover, onions and seaweed: Onion-skins very thin /
                        Mild winter coming in; / Onion-skins thick and tough, / Coming winter cold and rough.
                        ... animals, such as bats, dogs, rabbits, mice and swine: Bats flying late in the evening
                        indicate fair weather.
                        ... and miscellaneous matter, such as lamps, rope, soap, smoke and aching teeth. Lamps, from the
                        manner in which they burn, forebode weather. Before rain they burn less bright, the flame snaps
                        and crackles...
                        Feline Forecasters

                        And cats. Lots of cats.
                        "Cats have the reputation of being weather wise," according to the book. "It is almost
                        universally believed that good weather may be expected when the cat washes herself, but bad when
                        she licks her coat against the grain, or washes her face over her ears or sits with her tail to
                        the fire."
                        Now in 2014, we seem to be doing pretty well with the technology. Maybe we should focus some of
                        our attention on the world around us 窶?especially cats. As these weather proverbs from that
                        long-ago book suggest:
                        • When cats sneeze it is a sign of rain.
                        • When a cat scratches itself, or scratches on a log or tree, it indicates approaching rain.
                        • The cardinal point to which a cat turns and washes her face after a rain shows the direction
                        from which the wind will blow.
                        • When cats lie on their head with mouth turned up expect a storm.
                        • When cats are snoring, foul weather follows.

                Cats might be cuddly, but their love nibbles can be a serious health matter. Who would've thought those
                tiny teeth could be so dangerous?

                Kids read to cats
                Pupils improve reading skills by sharing books with shelter cats
                “The dogs’ teeth are blunter, so they don’t tend to penetrate as deeply and they tend to leave a larger
                wound after they bite," senior study author Dr. Brian Carlsen, a Mayo Clinic plastic surgeon and
                orthopedic hand surgeon, said... The cats’ teeth are sharp and they can penetrate very deeply, they can
                seed bacteria in the joint and tendon sheaths.”
                The researchers identified 193 patients who had went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. over the
                course of three years due to cat bites. Out of the patients who had to take a hospital bed because a cat
                gnawed on them, 67 percent needed cleaning and removal of dead, damaged or infected tissue.

                        Cats might be cuddly, but their love nibbles can be a serious health matter.
                        A study published in the February issue of The Journal of Hand Surgery showed that 30 percent of
                        patients who had a cat bite on hand ended up staying in a hospital for more than three days on
                        average.
                        Who would've thought those tiny teeth could be so dangerous?

                        Pupils improve reading skills by sharing books with shelter cats
                        “The dogs’ teeth are blunter, so they don’t tend to penetrate as deeply and they tend to leave a
                        larger wound after they bite," senior study author Dr. Brian Carlsen, a Mayo Clinic plastic
                        surgeon and orthopedic hand surgeon, said in a press release. "The cats’ teeth are sharp and
                        they can penetrate very deeply, they can seed bacteria in the joint and tendon sheaths.”
                        The researchers identified 193 patients who had went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. over
                        the course of three years due to cat bites. Fifty-seven of them had to be admitted to the
                        facilities, with an average stay of 3.2 days.
                        Oral antibiotics were given to 154 patients, but failed to work in 14 percent of cases. Those
                        patients ended up being hospitalized.

                        Out of the patients who had to take a hospital bed because a cat gnawed on them, 67 percent
                        needed cleaning and removal of dead, damaged or infected tissue. Eight of the patients needed
                        more than one operation.
                        Other injuries including erythema, a redness or rash on the skin due to damage to deeper skin
                        layers, and swelling were linked to a higher chance of needing a hospital stay.
                        Complications were also common in these cases, especially for those who were bit over a joint
                        like the wrist or a tendon sheath. People who were smokers and had immune system problems were
                        also more prone to having additional issues from a cat bite.
                        “It can be just a pinpoint bite mark that can cause a real problem, because the bacteria get
                        into the tendon sheath or into the joint where they can grow with relative protection from the
                        blood and immune system,” Carlsen said.

                Cat or dog? One of his students has built a program that can tell cat from dog 99 percent of the time.
                It could identify specific breeds of dogs and monkeys. And it could do it even if the monkey was in a
                tree, or the dog was under a bed. Artificial Intelligence

                        WhatsApp may be Facebook's latest prize, but it's not the company's most ambitious investment.
                        In recent months, the social networking giant has begun funding something potentially far more
                        revolutionary: artificial intelligence.
                        And it's not alone. Google and as of last week, Netflix, are all getting into a new kind of AI
                        known as deep learning. Deep learning programs are able to perceive their world in a way unlike
                        any other computer program, and these companies hope that deep learning programs will one day be
                        able to sort your photos, recognize your voice, and do a whole lot more.
                        Computers can already recognize some things. Take the scanner at the supermarket. You swipe your
                        block of cheese, and the scanner reads the bar code. Not that you would ever do this, but try
                        scanning something it doesn't expect 窶?like a cat 窶?and the machine will be hopelessly confused.
                        Yann LeCun, a computer scientist at New York University, is developing deep learning programs.
                        He's trying to create a program that can recognize things without bar codes. Things it hasn't
                        seen before. Show his program a cat. And the program sees: nose, whiskers, ears, and takes a
                        guess.
                        The first time, it might guess dog. But the human user can correct it. And from that correction,
                        it figures out what it did wrong. "Then it adjusts, so that next time around it will give you a
                        better answer," LeCun says.
                        This is the key thing about LeCun's program: It learns to recognize things on its own, without
                        bar codes or labels. And it gets really good. One of his students has built a program that can
                        tell cat from dog 99 percent of the time.
                        Deep learning "really doesn't look like a computer program," says Gary Marcus a psychologist and
                        AI expert at New York University who doesn't work with LeCun.
                        He says ordinary computer code is written in very strict logical steps. "But what you'll see in
                        deep learning is something different; you don't have a lot of instructions that say: 'If one
                        thing is true do this other thing,' " he says.
                        Joaquin Phoenix stars in the film Her, in which his character falls in love with an operating
                        system. When will artificial intelligence programs like Siri evolve to the point where we'll
                        fall in love with them?

                        That's Just Like 'Her': Could We Ever Love A Computer?
                        One of several robots at the University of California, San Francisco's hospital pharmacy helps
                        manage and track its drug inventory.

                        Is Silicon Valley Automating Our Obsolescence?
                        On Super Bowl Sunday, an advertising startup that spun out from the research launches a website
                        where ad viewers can have their emotions observed and catalogued.

                        Instead of linear logic, deep learning is based on theories of how the human brain works. The
                        program is made of tangled layers of interconnected nodes. It learns by rearranging connections
                        between nodes after each new experience.
                        New supercomputers and giant databases of images make deep learning programs hugely powerful.
                        LeCun exposed one of his programs to a database filled with 1.5 million random pictures. After
                        going through every picture in the database, the program could identify pretty much everything.
                        It could identify specific breeds of dogs and monkeys. And it could do it even if the monkey was
                        in a tree, or the dog was under a bed.
                        LeCun's program was so good it got Facebook's attention. Late last year, he got a call from
                        Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. LeCun says the conversation was deep. "A lot of it was about
                        philosophy really: How do we go about building machines? Is it a good idea to try and build
                        intelligent machines to help Facebook's business?" he says.
                        At the end of the call, LeCun got a new job: he's now director of AI research at Facebook.
                        LeCun says deep learning will soon change the way Facebook and other companies handle your
                        images. It may be possible for Facebook's search engine to know the face of a friend, or to
                        organize images that are taken in the same place or with the same people. "You're going to have
                        similar things happening for video," he adds.
                        NYU's Gary Marcus says there are limits to what deep learning can do. It can hear words, for
                        example, but it can't really understand what a sentence means. "Google, I think, would like to
                        build search engines that understand the English language, and deep learning's not really
                        powerful enough to do that," he says. "But it's powerful enough to help with a lot of things."

            <autn:summary>An akk dog
                At least one dog lived in Anchorhead. Ken sometimes wished he had a pet dog or cat instead of a pet
                mooka. The K-9 series companion droids were designed to imitate a dog in both appearance and
                behavior.The Lost Jedi Adventure Game Book

                Several other creatures, such as the akk dog and the Cyborrean battle dog, may have been related to
                dogs, or named for dogs due to similar behavior and habits. Dog" was also sometimes used as a term of
                contempt. Though most mentions of dogs referred to non-sentient domestic animals, at least one sentient
                being existed who was only identified as a "dog."

                        Dogs were domesticated animals noted for their keen sense of smell and their barking
                        vocalizations.Lost City of the Jedi They were often kept as pets by Humans and other species,
                        such as Talz. A similar, more wild canid, was a wolf.

                        An akk dog
                        At least one dog lived in Anchorhead.

                        In their youth, both Luke Skywalker and Lando Calrissian owned dogs, though Lando's was run over
                        by a hovercraft. The memory would haunt Calrissian for years to come.Lando Calrissian and the
                        Flamewind of Oseon Likewise, Luke would reflect upon his pet as he left the Tatoo system for the
                        first time on the Millennium Falcon. Ken sometimes wished he had a pet dog or cat instead of a
                        pet mooka. The K-9 series companion droids were designed to imitate a dog in both appearance and
                        behavior.The Lost Jedi Adventure Game Book

                        Several other creatures, such as the akk dog and the Cyborrean battle dog, may have been related
                        to dogs, or named for dogs due to similar behavior and habits.

                        "Dog" was also sometimes used as a term of contempt. A Mandalorian mercenary once referred to
                        the bounty hunter Durge as Jaing's "dog."Prototypes Likewise, while C-3PO's head was temporarily
                        attached to a B-1 battle droid's body during the Battle of Geonosis, he was heard to shout,
                        "Die, Jedi dogs!"

                        Though most mentions of dogs referred to non-sentient domestic animals, at least one sentient
                        being existed who was only identified as a "dog." This being was an associate of the mercenary
                        bunny Max.

                        Behind the scenes
                        As with most Earth animals featured in the Star Wars canon, the status and origins of the dog
                        remain a mystery. Quite a few organisms in the Star Wars galaxy have obvious real-world
                        analogues that share the same name, such as ducks; rabbits; horses; chickens; frogs; cats; and,
                        of course, Humans.
                        George Lucas and Indiana
                        Dog-related words such as hound, are used figuratively in some sources. These may be further
                        examples of the place of dogs in the culture of the Star Wars galaxy.
